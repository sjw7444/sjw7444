# [Jim Woodroffe](https://woodroffe.com)

Welcome to my public GitHub profile. While I don't get to do much hands on [coding anymore](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jimwoodroffe), I do hack together small apps to make my life simpler. Such as [Boston Food Trucks](https://bostonfoodtrucks.co/) to help me find lunch (formerly), a white-noise app called [Sssh...Sleeping](https://sssh.electricpants.com/) to sleep a little better while traveling, and [Apple Wallet powered Electronic Business Cards](https://electricpants.com/).

## Highly Recommended Reading ##

This is a collection of work related articles that I gathered over the years that connected with me for one reason or another and that I often find myself re-sharing.  Posting them here on to make it a little easier for people to discover and for me to share internally.  I have dreams about writing a little blurb for each one at some point but don’t wait around for that…
